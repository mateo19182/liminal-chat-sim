Simple UI for having multiple LLM agents chatting to each other.

Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

Right now set up with a model finetuned on Miguel Anxo Bastos. (https://github.com/mateo19182/bastos-finetune)


TODO:
- simplify code
- set prompt on ui
- images generated with sdturbo inrealtime, also whisper
- create more finetuned models

ultimate idea its a book/theater play that writes itself infinetly...
